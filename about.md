I started this site in August 2015 at the age of 23 for many reasons, the main ones being to blog about my adventures as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Gambia and to reassure my friends and family that I'm still alive with my (hopefully) regular posts.

### Short Bio

I was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, MX. to (wonderful) parents Ricardo Espinosa de los Monteros Moranchel and Marina Gonzalez Muñiz on January 18th, 1992. I have a two brothers, Rodrigo and Diego. They are two years older and 5 years younger than me, respectively.

We moved around a lot in our childhoods. We started out in Guadalajara, then Monterrey, then Muscatine, Iowa, then back to Monterrey, then Ciudad Juarez, and finally in Jasper, IN where my parents currently reside. After graduating from Jasper High School in 2010. I went on to the University of Southern Indiana in nearby Evansville, where I lived for my 4 years of college. 

After graduating in the summer of 2014 with bachelor degrees in International Studies and Spanish, I moved to Indianapolis in order to finish my citizenship process and Peace Corps application. After finally gaining citizenship in Feb 2015, I received an invitation for the Peace Corps on April 14th, 2015 with a departure date of Oct 10th, 2015.

These months in between have consisted of all sorts of preparations such as gaining medical, dental, and legal clearance, lots of rock climbing, buying and collecting all the things I think I'll need for my 27 months abroad.
