# Trees, Bees, and places to Pee.
### Almost at the 6 month mark, finished up "3 month challenge", relaxing is hard work and hard work is relaxing.
#### Date: 03/18/2016

Hello again,

As the sub-title suggests, my 6th month mark is quickly coming up and my beard is loving it (it's past Lieutenant Riker length and halfway into it's Tom Hanks' castaway stage).

Before I get into the three subjects that the title suggests, I think you folks need a good overview of the different stages that I have gone through of service in Peace Corps the Gambia. It goes as follows:


1. Arrival in the Gambia, spend a week in Kombo (the capital area) having sessions on medical, administrative, and behavioral protocols, and then we head to training village for two and a half months to take part in PST (Pre-Service Training).

2. Training village consists being grouped up with a 2 or 3 other PCT's (Peace Corps Trainees) and an LCF (Language and Culture Facilitator) of 4-6 hours of language training a day, along with cultural learning in class and everyday life, a few days where we learn how to get around, a few days doing technical training at the Massembeh training center, a few days are spent visiting our permanent site, and then getting to know our fellow PCT's and PCV's (Peace Corps Volunteers).

3. After our time in training village, we head back to the capital for a week to have our swear-in ceremony (PCT's are sworn in as PCV's) and then a general debrief of our time in Training Village.

4. After these first 3 months, we finally get to move into the places that will be our homes for the next 2 years and take part in what PCG (Peace Corps the Gambia) calls "3 month challenge". 3 month challenge essentially means that you stay in your new home village as much as possible for the first 3 months in order to solidify language skills, learn about your community, figure out potential projects that are needed by and your community, and integrate as much as possible.

5. After these first 3 months in village, PCG holds IST (In-Service Training) for the Agriculture/Forestry/Environment group in order to further develop our technical skills in beekeeping, gardening, farming techniques, environmental practices, project planning and development, behavior change sessions, and a bunch of other things that will be useful to us throughout the next two years.

6. As soon as IST is over we are pretty much free to do as much or as little as we want to do, but it's usually the former. This period of time tends to be one of the busiest all year because all of the older volunteers plan to have many meetings, treks, and other region/country-wide activities now that our 3 month challenge is over and we can now freely attend these events.
