# First real post.

### Info on the Gambia, this site, and what I've been doing to prepare for this adventure.

#### Date: 9/9/2015

######First of all, thanks for coming to my blog. It's still in it's early stages of development but in my opinion it looks good enough to begin writing in it. I will continue to change and mess with the formatting of the coverpage and blog itself. (Suggestions/grammar corrections, etc.. are welcome in the comment section below!)

For those of you who don't know about [The Gambia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia) it is a small country located in north-west Africa.

Like most west African countries, it struggles with many problems that lead to a much lower standard of living than we are used to in countries like the U.S.
My job title with the Peace Corps is as an Agricultural Extension Volunteer, and being a month away from my departure date you think I would know a a lot more about what my day to day will be like, but alas I do not.
What I do know is that I will be living in a rural community, trying to improve the living conditions with the help of other PC volunteers and our Gambian counterparts. I will post pics/videos and other hopefully interesting original content as soon as I am in country.

My preparations have consisted of many things:
	

1. Buying some cool equipment (65L hiking backpack, mosquito/bug proof, hammock, sleeping pad, and some other cool outdoor gear) in order to be ready for the everyday living conditions which I -maybe naively- see as an extended camping trip.
2. Trying to go and see as many people as I can before I leave, while also going out of town to test out my cool camping gear (solely for the sake of testing it out; no fun was had on these awesome camping and rock climbing trips. lol) with my brother Rod and friends from our climbing gym.
3. Doing a few more conventions to make a bit of money with my awesome friends at CPO!
4. And lastly building this website/blog with very little experience and lots of my brothers help.

Well this is is for my first post. Stay classy, you few blog readers.

P.S. Put some comments up and tell me how great or awful of a job I'm doing with this website.
