Whats up everyone?

So after being here for a month and a half my language is coming along slowly.
I've been traveling between Kaiaf (my training village), Massembeh (PC training site), Soma, and recently Mademba Kunda (my permanent site).

I just got back to Kaiaf after three days in Madembe Kunda and I must say my permanent site is awesome.
6k from the beach, palm trees everywhere, the man I'll be working with a lot (Modou Jallow) is a boss, my host family is great. So no complaints.

Here's a map showing the places I've travelled.

I'm in Soma again so no pics or vids but I'll be in Kombo (capital region) in two weeks.
Hope to post more then.


Until then, 
probably the only Toubab you know.
