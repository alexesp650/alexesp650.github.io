# Update on progress and testing video blog options.
### Travel updates
#### Date: 10/01/2015

######First of all, thanks to everyone that has helped me and donated to my cause. I will continue to change and mess with the formatting of the website (Suggestions/grammar corrections, etc.. are welcome in the comment section below!)

What's up everybody.

Only 8 days until departure.......

This post was originally supposed to be a test post to see if I can embed youtube videos directly into each post to see if I can maybe do some video-blogging like the kids are doing these days. But I thought I might as well give you few readers an update.

I received a great deal of support on my GoFundMe (thanks to everyone who donated and spread the word!) and I've purchased most the stuff I think I'll need. A GoPro Hero1, two 10-watt solar panels and battery, a kelty hiking backpack, teva hiking sandals, and a few other random items.

I've been taking this time of preparations in packing, building this website, working/traveling with my fine friends over at CPO, and going on what I like to call ym goodbye tour. It has basically consisted of seeing everyone I can before I leave but it sounds way cooler if I call it a tour.

Thanks for reading,

Your friendly neighborhood blog writer.

Below is the test video (hope it works).
