# Q&A with a man from the bush.
**Many people (I'm looking at you Bekah) have asked me many questions about life in the Gambia, so this post will be all about said questions and their answers.**
**Date: 04/09/2016**

### Q:  Is there enough food, what type of foods do you eat, and what's the weirdest thing you've eaten so far?

**A:** There's more than enough for everyone to eat but that doesn't mean that vitamin and other deficiencies aren't pretty common. 
Most dishes consist of a base of carbs (rice, coos, spaghetti noodles) with a sauce (peanut, moringa, potato leaf, tomato), vegetables (eggplant, squash, cabbage, bitter tomato, etc..), and sometimes protein (usually fish but sometimes beef, chicken, or goat) on top of them.

###### This is called Benachin, one of my favorites

###### This is one of my least favorites, those are like meatballs but boney ground fish....

And the weirdest things I've ever had are Monitor Lizard and giant Bush Rat, both were fried and eaten as a snack and the majority of people don't like to eat either.

### Q: Is life slower compared to the bustle of America?

**A:** Life and the culture are definitely suited to a slower pace. Not to say people work less but it's definitely dependent on the season and harvest times for different tree orchards, gardens, and staple crops. But the best part about it is that no one will blame you if you take an afternoon nap (which I constantly do).

### Q: Do people buy most of their things at stores or do they mostly live of the land?

**A:** Well..... both. Everyone here is a farmer or gardener at some point of their life but since crops are seasonal and most people don't live on steady paychecks but on intermittent income as the crops are harvested and sold. Most people do go to the local market to buy many of their vegetables on a daily basis but they also go sell their own when harvest time comes around.

### Q: What's the weather like?

**A:** Well the Gambia is a small country but it contains a pretty wide range of climates. The year is basically split into two seasons, the hot-rainy season (May - October) and the cold-dry season (November - April). Where I live, in the North West of the country, we have some of the best weather in the country. The hottest I've seen it around there is maybe around 95F around 3 or 4 PM and the coldest is probably around 60 F in the early hours of the morning. I guess we'll have to wait until the hot-rainy season to know about how much hotter it's supposed to be then.

### Q: I know you took your hammock with you, how much do you use it?

**A:** I don't use it a whole lot at site because I don't really have trees suitable for it in my backyard but I've definitely been using it when I travel to Massembeh and other trainings around the country.

### Q: What kinds of animals are in country and which have you seen?

**A:** Well Gambia is very well known for it's diverse wildlife, specially it's birds, there's like 400 different types of birds here. The one's that really stand out and are fairly common are Baboons, Black Monkeys, Red Monkeys, Emerald Green Monkeys, Bush Rats, Monitor Lizards, buncha different types of Snakes, Giant Porcupines Warthogs, Crocs, Hippos, and Chimps (in nature reserves).
I've only seen Crocs, the three types of colored monkeys, Bush Rats, a few snakes, a Monitor Lizard and a ton of the different types of birds (some are pretty cool looking).

### Q: Have you taken any trips yet? Do you have any planned?

**A:** As you can see from my last post, Peace Corps has had my last 6 months fairly well planned out for me so I haven't really gotten the chance to explore a whole lot. But I'm happy to say that I've just finished planning a trip to Senegal for the St. Louis Jazz Fest. My friend and fellow PCV Cody and I are going to Senegal for 8 days to meet up w another friend of his that is finishing his PC service in Zambia and is stopping by Senegal to hang out.

### Q: What's the most exciting thing about life?

**A:** Well that's a deep one.... Um... I'd have to say that the endless amount of things to learn is up there. Whether it's about yourself, new people, or just knowledge in any subject. Don't really know how to answer this any better...

### Q: What do people do for entertainment?

**A:** All sorts of things, the cluster of villages of which I live in is fairly large and therefore we have a lot of events (naming ceremonies, circumcision ceremonies, marriage ceremonies, etc..) that people love to attend. Everyone dresses up in their best clothes and after a brief..ish prayer, women, children, and some men go dance and such while a hired DJ plays music on a sound system while the majority of the men sit around and talk while they drink Attaya and eat kola nuts. This usually involves a few Kangkurans dancing around and scaring the women and children.

###### Kangkurans!

On a more everyday basis a lot of people just pass the time by sitting around and chatting but each gender/age group does a few things differently.

Men and usually sit around brewing and drinking attaya while they chat.

Women will chat as they cook, make palm brooms, braid hair, make bead jewelry, or nurse their children.

Young men play football or sit around listening to music and brewing attaya.

Young women will sit around listening to music or chatting with the opposite gender or just gossiping among themselves.

Children will just run around between many different compounds and play like children do, all the whilst trying to annoy everyone they can enough to receive threats but avoid a beating.

So pretty average stuff really....

### Q: Predictions for the winner of GoT?

**A:** I have a theory that Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen will team up somehow and take control with the backing of the Lord of Light.

### Q: What's the life expectancy and how is the medical care there?

**A:** So statistically speaking, life expectancy of those past the age of 5 is pretty drastically different than if you include those children under the age of 5 since so many unfortunately succumb to malaria and other diarrhea inducing illnesses. Not including children under 5 it's around 60 but I would say that women tend to outlive men in most places.

Medical care is a very tricky subject, most of the Gambia has health facilities within a short distance but people are not very inclined to go there because of many factors. Traveling costs money, there are many traditional healers and alternative medicines (with varying degrees of success) readily available, lack of knowledge about many health risks, etc... Although health care is provided by the government many people just don't know about or have realistic access to the facilities.

### Q: Is drug use prevalent there?

**A:** Drug is not very prevalent at all. Weed is fairly common but I don't think any other drugs are. Also all drugs are illegal and this is fairly well enforced. Also alcohol use is mostly limited to  tourists, Christians, and a few outliers. Besides the Muslim religion being very against drugs and alcohol, I really think that the strong community and family support tends to be very good prevention to these issues.

### Q: Have you seen the new Star Wars?

**A:** Not yet but I just got a copy of bad ass quality and I'm planning on watching it tonight with a bunch of other people that are equally or more excited to watch it!

Signing off,

The bushman.
