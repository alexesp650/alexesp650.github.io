# Meet the Jarjus.
### My new home.
#### Date: 02/07/2016

Meet the Jarjus, this is seven of the thirteen people of my Gambian family.

![The Jarju Family]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Jarjus.jpg =100x20)

The people in this pic are: 

**Ibrahima (host son/nephew?), Fatou (host daughter/niece), Lamin (host son/nephew).**

**Karamo (host brother), Binta (host wife/sister-in-law), Buba (host son/nephew).**

**and Baba (host son/nephew) is asleep in Karamos lap.**

The reason I write son/nephew and such is beacause Karamo is my host brother but in Gambia most people will call his kids my kids, his wife my wife, and so on.

The others that live in my compound but aren't in the picture are **Na Gibba (host mother), Bah Alieu (host uncle), Mafuji (host cousin), Mariama (host sister) Majula(host cousin?), and Basi (family friend?)**

They are all super cool and welcoming and offer different perspectives that help me with integration into the village because of their age, sex, interests, and day to day activities. 

They are a Muslim family (like most families in the Gambia). 

They belong to the Jola tribe but mostly speak Mandinka in their home life.

Let's start with Na Gibba. She is my host mother and Karamo's mother. She's older but I can't even begin to speculate on old peoples ages here. It's really hard to tell. Her husband, Pa Dembo, passed a way a few years ago, maybe 5, and her children are spread out around the Gambia and one of them lives in the U.K. She currently is suffering from a broken leg and is therefore bedridden but she loves to talk with me, even though we can barely understand each other, and is constantly having all her friends visit her just to talk and such.

Karamo, my host brother is the oldest male in the compound and therefore the compound head. He is an honest and hardworking man that deeply cares for the well being and education of his family. He has never attended school but he is a fairly intelligent man and speaks decent English and perfect Mandinka, Jola, Wolof, and some Pullar. In the past he has worked as a farmer (like most Gambian men), fisherman, and orchard keeper but he now works at the airport in Kombo (the capital area) and therefore is only home for 1 or 2 days a week and spends the rest of the time in the capital.

Binta is Karamos first and only wife, (men are allowed to have up to four wives here). She is the one who pretty much runs the compound. She is really smart and funny. She reads and writes in Mandinka, which is a very rare thing, speaks pretty decent English but understands it much better, speaks perfect Pullar, Wolof, Jola, and some Serere. She makes sure that 3 meals are prepared everyday, that the kids all go to school, buys everything the house needs, helps me with languages, and loves to give me shit about pretty much everything.

Karamo and Bintas kids are Lamin ~15, Fatou ~13, Bubacarr (Buba) ~8, Pa Dembo (Baba) ~6. I'm totally guesstimating on the ages because even they don't know their exact birthdays unless they look up their birth certificate. They all go to school and act pretty similar to how American kids do at those ages. Lamin is really smart, speaks decent english but is not super motivated with school as it seems like he get bored by it and is ahead of most, if not all, of his class mates. Fatou is super sweet and goes above and beyond to help me with anything, she constantly want to help me get my water, sweep my house, wash my laundry, etc. She also speaks decent english and seems to do well in school and is pretty motivated. As expected Buba and Baba are little trouble makers. They never want to go to school and I've had to drag/carry/beat/bribe them from them to go to school. They love to play and are pretty fun to hang around with. Baba is probably the family member I hang out the most with and is a funny kid when he isn't being a little shit.

Bah Alieu is an older man, maybe 60, that likes to work in the mornings and chill and listen to the radio the rest of the day. He's quiet and mostly keeps to himself but his room is right next to mine so we talk from time to time. He has some international knowledge, I assume it's from listening to the radio, and loves to have me (with a translator to help) show him maps and where other countries and locations are around the world.

Mariama is my host sister and is around 18 years old. She helps with cooking and house chores in the morning and goes to school in the afternoon-evening. Her english is pretty good and helps me in learning Mandinka as well.

Now Mafuji (Mafu) ~24, Basilu (Basi) ~21, Ibrahima ~16, and Majula ~11 are not exactly family members but they live in my compound and my family provides them with shelter and food. 

Mafu is a second cousin or something like that. His parents live in Guinea, but his grandmother lives alone in a small house right behind our compound, he does odd work around the village, makes attayah, and plays soccer. 

Basi is our tailor in residence and I have no idea how he came to live with us, he has a tailoring shop in the front of my compound and therefore makes me sweet Gambian clothes. 

Ibrahima does odd work around the village and no longer goes to school. From what I understand his father died and his mother left to another city leaving him with nowhere to go so my family took him in. 

Majula is also a second cousin or something like that but her parents live in Guinea Bissau and she shares a grandma with Mafuji (I think they're cousins). Her little sister, Isatou, lives with their grandmother and they are always together, playing and doing chores. They're both sweet girls that like to help with chores around the house when they're not at school.

That was a lot to write and I'm getting sick of sitting at a restaurant drinking coke, so I'll try and make another blog post soon!

Until then,
